# Complex-Calculator
Done in vacations between 3rd and 4th Sem Engineering(Jan-Feb 2020). This code is a complex calculator with all arithmetic,trigonometric,exponential and logarithmic functions.It takes in an input string,recognises the operators and the operand from the string and gives out the appropriate response. It also stores 100 recent inputs with their respective outputs(History) and allows storage of 4 variables in memory to the user. More Functionalities/Operations,Keywords can be seen when executing the code. INPUT: A String Containing the operators and function/operand(keyword) OUTPUT: Result/Appropriate response. There are a few bugs(described in code comments) which shall be addressed later.
